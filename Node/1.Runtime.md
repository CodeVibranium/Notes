# About node runtime

1. Node runtinme is an enviornment which provides all necessary components in order to use and run a js program outside browser.

- External Dependencies
  - libvu
  - v8
  - zlib
  - crypto
- C++ features
  - file system access
  - networking
- JS features
  - utilities to tap into js code

2. Javascript is blocking, synchronous and single threaded language

   - synchronous, any one program is executed top-down at any given time.
   - blocking, becuase of its synchronous nature, the next process dosent start util the earlier one is finished
   - single threaded, a thread is simply a process that your js program can use ti run a task and each thread can do only one task at a time.

# Web Framework

- A framework is simply an abstraction of the lower level code allowing you the devloper to focus on the requirements that the code itselfs.
  examples- express, nest, hapi, koa and sails.
  They are build on top if node http module>>

# Libuv

- A cross platform open source library written in C.
- Handles asynchronous non-blocking operations in nodejs
- uses thread pool and event loop

## Thread pool

- A pool of threads that node js uses to offload time consuming task and ensure that main thread is not blocked with time consuming tasks.
- `process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=5`
- by increasing thread pool size we are able to improve the total time taken to run multiple calls of an asynchronous method.
- NOTE: If you increase the pool size beyond the limit of cores available on your machine the OS scheduler, it juggles between mutiples threads across n cores, it switches threads between cores as each thread get equal amount of time.

## Netwrok I/O

- A http req is a network bound input/output operation and not a CPU bound opearation
- HTTP req doesnt use thread pool
- doesnt get affected by CPU cores
- Libuv delegates the work to the opeating system kernel and whenever possible it will poll the kernel and if the request has completed.
  > How kernel makes a network call?

Node js async methods are handled by either on these ways

1. Native async mechanism
2. Thread pool

- Whenever possible linuv will use native async mechanism to avoid blocking the main thread
  As this is part of the kernel there is different mechanism for each OS.
  - we have epoll for Linux
  - Kqueue for Macos
  - IO completetion PORT for Windows

# How code is executed in a Node js env

- V8 engines executes JS code, it comprises of
  1.  Memory Heap
      - Declaring variable and functions, memory is allocated in heap
  2.  Call stack
      - Functions exeuted here, follows stack principle.

## Event loop

- Event loop is a design pattern that co-ordinates the execution of sync and async code in nodejs
- A loop that is alive as long as node js app is running
- In each iteration we come across 6 different queues. Each queue holds one or more callbacks fubc that would eventually executed in the call stack.
  - Lib UV queue
  1. Timer queue (callbacks associated with `setTimeout` and `setInterval`)
  2. I/O queue (callbacks associated with all async methods fs and http module )
  3. Check queue (callbacks associated with `setImmediate`)
  4. Close queue (callbacks associated with `close events`)
  - Micro task queue [Node js]
  1. next tick queue (callbacks associated with `process.nextTick()` func)
  2. promise queue (callbacks associated with native `js` promises)

## Execution order

1. user written js sync code (only after call stack is empty event loop comes into picture )
2. process.nextTick()
3. promise queue
4. timer q
5. process.nextTick()
6. promise queue
7. i/o queue (polling is done if no callbacks present moves to next q)
8. process.nextTick()
9. promise queue
10. check queue
11. process.nextTick()
12. promise queue
13. close queue
14. process.nextTick()
15. promise queue

Note `setImmediate` queue runs before `setTimeout` queue.
