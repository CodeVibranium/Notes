# Application Load Balancing

1. target groups
   - EC2 instances
   - ECS tasks
   - Lambda functions
   - Ip address: must be pvt ip address
   - An ALB can be connected to multiple target group, where each group can do a specific tasks
2. Example
   - ALB
     - Target group AWS EC@
     - Target Grouo on premises Private group
3. Application server dont see the ip of client directly
   - A client makes a req to some server( which here would be load balancer)
   - Load balancer based on health checks of ec2 machines / taget groups it will forward that req to that machines
   - This process is called **Connection termination**
   - For the EC2 machine to know the ip of the req it has to look in these headers
     - X=FORWARDED-FOR
     - X-FORWARDED-PORT
     - X-FORWARDED_PORTO
