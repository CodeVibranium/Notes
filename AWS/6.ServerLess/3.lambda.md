# Lambda

- lambda function is a serverless,
  - it means we only pay as long as our function is runninhg
- lambda is managed service by AWS
  - AWS lambda will scale the lambda functions
- theyn are event driven
- lambda starts
  - cold starts
  - hot start
- when an event triggers
  - lambda first downloads your code (cold start)
  - start new execution enviornment (cold start) varies from (100ms to 1 second)
  - execute intiliaztion code (hot start)
  - excute handler code
- Reduce cold start by **Provision concurrency**
  - we will keep some execution enviorment created for a lambda
  - upon req we only have to handle the request, instead of cold start
- The best way to create lamda function is to not use AWS console.

# API gateway

- is a fully managed restful api service
- can by used by iot, mobile, web vpc, on premisies etc...
- can enable api gateway cache, improve latency
- API gateway can acess other various AWS services
- API gateway can be attacjed with private application, and other personal api

## DynamoDB

- it gaurantues single **milli second latency** for any scale
- U can cache data, with (DEX), dynamo accelator in order reduce latency further at **micro** second level
