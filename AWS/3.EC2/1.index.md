1. what is a EC2 Reserved Instance?

## Facts

- Compute Optimized EC2 instances are great for compute-intensive workloads requiring high-performance processors (e.g., batch processing, media transcoding, high-performance computing, scientific modeling & machine learning, and dedicated gaming servers).
- Reserved Instances are good for long workloads. You can reserve EC2 instances for 1 or 3 years.
- EC2 User Data is used to bootstrap your EC2 instances using a bash script. This script can contain commands such as installing software/packages, download files from the Internet, or anything you want.
- Storage Optimized EC2 instances are great for workloads requiring high, sequential read/write access to large data sets on local storage.
- Security Groups can be attached to multiple EC2 instances within the same AWS Region/VPC.
- Dedicated Hosts are good for companies with strong compliance needs or for software that have complicated licensing models. This is the most expensive EC2 Purchasing Option available.
