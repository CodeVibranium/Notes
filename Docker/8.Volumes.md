# Docker volumes

- A volume acts as a pointer to our local file system, the pro with tthis is that when ever we make changes to our local fs the changes are automatically relected in the docker container as well as the file is referenced.
- `docker run -p 3000:3000 -v/usr/my-app/node_modules -v $(pwd):/usr/my-app a292a9e0c5a7b94432ff8cac846e825bbc38`
