# Microservices Architecture

You are developing a microservices-based application, where one microservice is written in Node.js and another one in Python (Flask). Both microservices communicate with each other.

- The Node.js microservice is in a directory named node_service and listens on port 3002.
- The Flask microservice is in a directory named python_service and listens on port 3003.
- Both microservices need to communicate with each other and should be on a dedicated network.
- Both microservices need to communicate with an external Redis cache, which should be in a different network.
