# Scenario 4: Network Isolation

- You have three services: service_A, service_B, and service_C.
- service_A should be able to communicate with both service_B and service_C.
- service_B should only communicate with service_A and not service_C.
- service_C should only communicate with service_A and not service_B.
- service_A uses the Nginx image, service_B uses a MySQL image, and service_C uses a Redis image.
