# Creating a new docker image

1. Create a new Docker file
   - `Dockerfile`
   - Comments- `#`
2. `docker build .`
   - `.` is called build context
   - means set of files we want to include in the build
3. `docker run imageId`
4. `docker build -t shahedali/simpleweb .`
   - gives your created docker image a name
5. ` docker run -p 3000:3000 shahedali/simpleweb`
   - run the created docker image with port forwarding
6. `COPY ./ ./usr/app`
   - all the files for the build will be copied in to this directory in the container.
