# Data Persistence methods in docker

- By default container are ephemeral
- Data stored in tmpfs mounts is fast and secure but will be lost once the container is terminated

## Docker Volumes

- A preferred way to persist data generated and utilized by a Docker container.
- A **volume is a directory on the host machine** Docker uses to store files and directories that can outlive the container’s lifecycle.

## Bind points

- Bind mounts allow you to map any directory on the host machine to a directory within the container.

## TMPFS

- Docker tmpfs mounts allow you to create a temporary file storage directly in the container’s memory
- Data stored in tmpfs mounts is fast and secure but will be lost once the container is terminated
