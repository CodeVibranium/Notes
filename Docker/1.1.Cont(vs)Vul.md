# Containerzation vs Virtualization

## Containerzation

- It is the process of packaging code dependencies, enviornment variables, external libraries, and runtime dependencies ignoring user namespcae and all required to run the single process
- It uses the user host kernel (linux) to do the operation required by the porcess
- It will not use/build a complete OS to run the process
- It uses less space
- It starts and stops fast
- Each Process is islotaed from user namespace
- Multiple containers can run of same machine and share user kernel
- A container is **Efficinet** bcz of less overhead and shre common libraires and executable file
- A container is **Portable** bcz it encapsulated apllication and depencies so that it run accross platforms
- A container is **Fast** as it does not need full OS
- A container proivdes a **Consistent enviornment**
- Each container runs on top of a **container engine** which is a software that emulates the operating system if a computer, helps to run multiple applications on a single server and provides isolation between running containers.

## Virtualization

- It is process of running a complete different OS on the host OS.
- It uses hypervisor to achieve it
- It takes up lot of space and inlcudes all the other files which are not required by the process to run but required to start the OS.
- It stats and stops slow.

## Container

- A Container isolates applications from their environment, ensuring they work consistently across different systems.
