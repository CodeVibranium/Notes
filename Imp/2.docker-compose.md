# Docker compose

- it ised to combine multiple service and conncectthem simply
- used to bring up the complete application stack
- allmpossible only when everythingh is running on single docker host

## Application without using docker compose

1. FE & BE written in python (SSR)
   1. used for taking votes
2. redis to store data ASAP
3. .net worker to update data to persistent db
4. persistent db used here is postgres
5. Another FE application developed using Node (SSR)
   1. used for displaying votes

- Commands
- --link (name of container): (name of the host the app is looking for in code )
- -d run in bg
  - docker run -d --name=redis redis
  - docker run -d --name=db postgres
  - docker run -d --name=vote -p 5000:80 --link redis:redis voting-app
  - docker run -d --name=result -p 5001:80 --link db:postgres result-app
  - docjer run -d --name=worker --link redis:redis --link db:postgres worker

## Now Docker-compose.yml

```yml
version: 1

redis:
	image: redis #  image available on docker hub
db:
	image: postgres #  image
vote:
	build: ./vote-app # this will tell docker to build instead of pulling from docker hub
	# image: voting-app # own application
	ports:
		- 5000:80
	links:
		- redis
result:
	build: ./result-app
	# image: result-app # own application
	ports:
		- 5001:80
	links:
		- db # db:db = db
worker:
	build: ./worker-app
	# image: worker # own application
	links:
		- db: db
		- redis: redis
```
