# Normalization

- it is process of
- minimizing redundant data
- minimizung data modifications
- simplyfying queies
- drawbacks would be
- Performamnce issue like joins
- DB can become complex due to more tables

## Stages of Normalization

1. 1NF
2. 2NF
3. 3NF

## 1NF

- it states that each column must have only one value
- and each record must be unq

## 2NF

- it states the each non-key column must only/fully depend on the primary key of the record

## 3NF

- it states that there should be no transtive dependencies of non-key attributes on the primary key
- atransitive dependency is an indirect relation ship that causes functional dependency
- which means, a change in one filed can lead to change in another filed, that was not direclty associated with it
- for example consider a table students
- students has -> studentId | couseName | Teacher Name
- Teacher teaches a subject and a student is enrolled into a subject
- so, in students table there is no need of teacher name becuase a teacher teaches a subject not a student
- but ultimately teacher has to teach it to a student only, thus making a transtive dependecy
- so **3NF** fixes this transitive dependency by moving the transitive data into seperate tab;e
- so we can create a new table called couses, which has courseId | courseName | teacher
- and student table can have = studentId| coyrseId
