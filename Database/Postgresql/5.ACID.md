# ACID

1. Atomicity
   - Ensures that a tranction should either be fully completed or not executed at all. This means in case successfull transaction it should persist data and in case of failure the db data must remian same.
2. Consistency
   - Data consistency is maintained by enforcing constraints, (pk,fk,notnull,check, unq). Whenver **db** executes a transaction it first check for if these constaints meet if they dont meet the transcation is cancelled and db remians in the same state as beofre.
   - To maintain consistent we have use `constraints`
   - Use `CHECK`
3. Isolation
4. Durability
