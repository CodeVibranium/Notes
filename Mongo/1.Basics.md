# Mongo DB

- Mongo db stores data in a document format

## Document

- Document is simply a record in Collection(table)
- They are stored in type-rich format known as `BSON`
- BSON is nothing but Binary representation of JSON a.k.a **binary-encoded serialization of JSON-like documents**
- Mongo db uses BSON because mongodb supports various languages, and to optimize query performance
- JSON is a lightweight and human-readable data representation format that can be easily parsed and generated by many programming languages.
- JSON cannot represent these data type: Dates, Binary data, etc.. these must be represented as strings
- BSON stores **dates, objectId,Binary, decimal28**
- BSON **helps** speed up data processing and supports the use of additional data types not available in standard JSON
