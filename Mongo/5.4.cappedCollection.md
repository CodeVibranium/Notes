# Capped Collections

- Collection which are meant to have only limited documents either limited by size of no of documents
- Capped collections have fixed size
- Documents are stored in the order they were inserted
- Retreving document with specifying order will return documnets in which they were inserted
- When collection reaches maximun size the documnets are overWritten
- **FLAG** once a document is inserted it cannot be updated .If you want to modify delete the documnet and then insert it as new
- **FLAG** mongodb dosent allow expiring indexes in a capped collection because
  these collections are designed with performance in mind, because in a capped Collection documents are overWritten based on their **insertionOrder**
- The main reason expiring indes removes documnets based on their time ofexpiry where as in a capped collection a dcoumnet is removed \ orverwritten based on their insertion order

## Code

db.createCollection("collectionNanme",{capped:True,size:1000BYTES})
db.createCollection("myCappedCollection", { capped: true, max: 100,sizeL32111});
