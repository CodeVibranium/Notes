# Query optimization

1. query optimiation is a process in which documnet are retrieved faster
2. The query optimizer helps in the selection of the appropriate query plan, enabling MongoDB to execute queries efficiently.
3. The primary goal of query optimizer is to minimize the no of **scanned || read** documents which reduce overall execution time

## Optimize query techniques

1. A well designed schema
2. Indexing
3. Explain method
   - explain the query plan and the behaviour and performace of the query
4. Profiling
   - helps to analyze and diagnose performance issues of the query

## Profiling

- it is process of logging certain activities or all activities of a db
- it captures detail information about db operation which will be helpful while troubleShooting, performace tuning and auditing
- LEVELS
  1. -1:
  2. 0 : profiling off
  3. 1 : Only operation that take longer that the current slow opeartion are written to syystem profile
  4. 2 : All operations are written irrespective of their latency
- `db.setProfilingLevel(0)`
- `db.getProfilingStatus()`
- These will be written
  1. op: operation type
  2. ts: time stamp of when this operation was logged
  3. ns: db and collection name
  4. user: user info who issued the command.
  5. command: which command runs
  6. nretured: num of documents returned
  7. responseLength: size of response in bytes
  8. millis: duration of operation in millis
  9. client: host and port no upon which this command run
  10. execStatus: execution statistics of the query
- Where these data will be written
  - `db.system.profile.find().pretty()`
