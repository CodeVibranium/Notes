# Info about fields

1. `auto_now_add` in django models is used to set the time of creation of the object
2. `auto_now` in django models is used to set the time of updation of the object
3. `def __str__` in django models is used to define a human-readable string representation of an object
   - used throughout Django's administrative interface
   - can be useful for debugging, as well as for making it easier to understand what a particular object represents when you are working with it in the Django shell or in the administrative interface
4. `manage.py` management script for the the project
5. `wsgi.py` (Web Server Gateway Interface) is used for serving a Django application using a traditional web server, such as Apache or Nginx,
6. `asgi.py` (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is used for serving a Django application using an asynchronous web server, such as Daphne, Channels, or Uvicorn.
   - when you need to handle multiple requests simultaneously and efficiently, with low overhead and latency.
   - Real-time applications,
   - Applications with heavy I/O requirements: such as file uploads and downloads, can use ASGI to handle these operations asynchronously and efficiently.
7. `many=True`
8. `readonly=True`

# Process based model

- refers to how Django handles multiple requests
- Each incoming request, Django will create a new process, which will run independently of other processes
- Each process runs in its own memory space, and is completely separate from other processes.
- This means that each process has its own set of variables, objects, and state, and is executed independently of other processes.
- Process is executed by the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer.

# Django request handling technique

1. The requests are received by the web server, such as Apache or Nginx, which acts as the front-end for the Django application.
2. The web server passes the requests to the Django application, which is running as a process on the same server or a different server.
3. Django processes each request by creating a new instance of the **Django request object**, which contains information about the request, such as the URL, headers, and body.
4. Django dispatches the request to the appropriate **view function**, which is responsible for handling the request and generating a response.
5. The view function retrieves the necessary data from the database, processes it, and generates a response, which is returned to the web server.
6. The web server sends the response back to the client, and the process starts over for each new request.
