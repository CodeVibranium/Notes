## Serialization and Deserialization

- Serialization is the process of converting a complex data structure, such as an object or a database record, into a format that can be stored or transmitted over a network. The data is typically stored in a string or binary format, such as JSON or XML.

- Deserialization is the opposite of serialization. It involves converting a serialized representation of an object or data structure back into its original form

- Serialization and deserialization are often used in web applications and APIs to transmit data between a client and a server. The client sends a request to the server in a serialized format, and the server returns a response that has been deserialized into a usable data structure.
