# Typescript

> Typescript = javascript

> The goal of typescript is

1. Help catch error during development
2. uses type annotations to analyze our code
3. only active during development
4. Dosent provide any performance optimization
5. No part of ts is sent to node/ browser

## FLOW

1. Typescript code
2. Typescript complier
3. Plain old javascript
4. typescriptlang.or/play
5. TS is a friend who is helping you catch errors while development

## Enviorment setup

1. `npm i -g typescript ts-node` (one time).

## Types

> Easy way to refer to the different properties + functions that a value has
> value are something which can be assignable
> Primitive data type

1. string
2. number
3. boolean
4. symbol
5. void
6. null
7. undefined
8. date

> Object type

1. object
2. array
3. function
4. classes

## TS uses types to analyze errors and allows other engg to know what values are flowing aroun our codebase

## Type Annotations

> code we add to tell TS what type of value a variable will refer to
> When to use annotations

1. Function that returns any type
2.

## Type Inference

> TS tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to

## ANY tpe
