# Storage Duration

- Determines the lifetime of the variable
- There are four types of storage durations
- Automatic
- Static
- Thread
- Dynamic

## Automatic Storage duration

- Variables are created and destroyed when they go out of scope
- These are used for normal variables

## Static Storage Duration

- Variables like `static` and global are **created** at the **start** of the program and deleted at the end of the execution of the program
- memory for static local variables is allocated when the program starts and only deallocated when the program exits.
- not on the stack
- They are initialized only once.

## Thread Storage duration

- These are for variables created using the `thread_local`.
- They live as long as the thread is alive

## Dynamic Storage duration

- variables declared using the `new` & `delete` key words
