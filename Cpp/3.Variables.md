# Variables

- **Declaration:** Variables are declared using their data types.
- **Behavior Modifiers**: The behavior of a variable can be modified using sp**ecific keywords**:

  - `static`
  - `const`
  - `global` (Note: There isn't a global keyword in C++. Instead, global variables are those declared outside of any function, class, or namespace.)

- **Global Variables**: Variables declared outside of any function, class, or namespace are considered global. They are accessible throughout the file and potentially from other files, and their value can be changed at any point unless they are declared as const.
- **Constant Variables**: Variables initialized using the const keyword cannot have their value changed after initialization. This holds true regardless of their scope.
- **Static Variables**: Variables declared with the static keyword retain their value even after the scope within which they were declared has ended.
  This retention property is especially useful for purposes like caching or counting function calls.
