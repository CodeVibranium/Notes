# Heap

1. Memory created in heap is not automatically delated as it is done by stack memory, in stack memory is grabage collected when ever a particular block of code is done executing but thats not the case with heap memory
2. In heap memory is created using the keyword **new**
3. Memory created in heap dosent have symbol table so space allocation using **new** will always return **Address** of the allocated memory
