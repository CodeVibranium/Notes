# Static Typing

- In cpp static typing means, the data type of variable is determined at complie time

## Dynamic typing

- Here the data type of a variable is determined at runtime
- Cpp has a provision to achieve dynamic typing
- void \* can point to any type of data.
- to wherever use that data in any way u first to tpe cast into its type and use it

```cpp
int x=10;
void*ptr = &x;
cout<< "value of x in ptr is "<< *(static_cast<int*>(ptr))<<endl;
```

## any

```cpp
#include<any>

any variableName;
variableName = 43;
variableName="Hello world"
variableName=1.23424;
variableName=false
```
