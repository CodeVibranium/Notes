# Bad practices

1. returning a pointer or reference variable created inside a function
2. creating an array of N size at runtime instead of complie time

## Creating a memory of N size of run time

- when a program is executed it comes with two types of memory.
- 1 is stack and and other is heap and stack is always smaller than heap
- so when u say the size of aarray when complie time the stack size comes with greater than that size,
- but if u say the size of array at run time, the program may crash due to limitation of size of memory at runtime.
- when ever u want to usem meory of heap we need to create the variable using **new** keyword.

## Static vs dynamic memory allocation

- program using memory from stack is called static memory
- program using memory from heap is called dynamic memory
- in dynamic memory u cant create variables but u can allocate some space
- `int \*arr = new int[10];`

## Do not create global variables

- Do not create global variables in CPP.
