# const- CONSTANT

- Its primary purpose is to make things immutable
- Usage

## `const` member function

- When a function has const to the right side it means that
- This function dosent modify the varables used in the class
- It simply reads them
  ```cpp
  string getData() const {
  data="Modifaction"// Compliation error
    return data;
  }
  ```

## Returning `const`

- This would be helpful when you have some data and your are retuning it
- Catch is, instead of returning the data, u return the address, reference to that data
- instead of copy
- But why would u do that,
- Memory effeciency
- So somebody having access to that memeoy can change the value
- to avaoid the u return it with const
- Which means, u can read that same value, but cannot edit, u r just sharing location
- instead of making a new copy
- anyone can access it, no need of variabes declared using const.

```cpp
	const string &getName const()
	{
		return graphName;
	}
```
