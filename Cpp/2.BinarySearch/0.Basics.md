# Binary search

- Binary search is an efficient searching algorithm which runs at logarithmic time, or O(log n), where n is the size of the array.
- Steps to implement it
- First find the middle element of the array, if the array length is even take any middle number.
- Then check if the number at middle index i equal to target number if equal u have found the number
- If not, check if the number is greater or lesser than the target number
- If the number is lesser than the target number move the left index to current index +1
- If the number is greater than the targte nhumber kove the right index the to the current index-1
- Repeat this process unless the both indexes crosss each other or u have found the target number.
