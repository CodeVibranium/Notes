# kafka producers

- topics hold data
- producers write data to a partitions
- producers know in advance which partion which topic certain data is written to
  - If a partion has a **failure** what will happen to that message for that topic
- A producers can write to multple partitions
- A producer can choose to send a **key** with each message
- If key is `null` the producer writes data to **all partitions in sequence**
- If key is `!=null`, data is written to one partition only.
- A key is part of a kafka message and it is responsible to decide in which partition a message is written to & used for ordering a specific field
- Which key is meant for which partition is done by some thing called as **Hashing technqie**.

## Message serializer

- only accepts bytes as i/p & o/p
- both key &value muist be in bytes
- keys are hashed using the `murmur2 algorithm`
- Consumer deserializer
- Consumer has to now in advance about the ds of message
