# Kafka Topic

- A Topic is a particular stream of data.
- It is like a database table but with no constraints
- A topic is unq by its name
- It can store any kind of message
- These sequence of message in a topic is called **message stream**
- You cannot directly query kafka topic, u have use producer to add data to a topic and use consumers to extract data from a topic.

## Partions

- A topic can be split into partitions
- A partition can hold multiple message which ordered w.r.t to entry time
- Each message has its own unq id which starts from `0`
- This id is called `kafka partion offset`
- once data is written to a partition it is immutable.
- data is kept for a limited time (default one week)
