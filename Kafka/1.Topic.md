# Kafka CLuster

- a cluster can have many topics
- a topic in uniquely idetefied by it name
- the sequence of message is called a data stream
- No querying possible in topic
- Add data to topic using **producers**
- Read data from topic using **consumers**
- A topic can be split into n partitions
- each message in a partaion has incremental id, which is also called as **Kafka partition offset**
- A topics are **immutable**, cannot update & delete.

# Kafka Topic

- A Topic is a particular stream of data.
- It is like a database table but with no constraints
- A topic is unq by its name
- It can store any kind of message
- These sequence of message in a topic is called **message stream**
- You cannot directly query kafka topic, u have use producer to add data to a topic and use consumers to extract data from a topic.

## Partions

- A topic can be split into partitions
- A partition can hold multiple message which ordered w.r.t to entry time
- Each message has its own unq id which starts from `0`
- This id is called `kafka partion offset`
- once data is written to a partition it is immutable.
- data is kept for a limited time (default one week)
