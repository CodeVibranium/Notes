# OS

- It is a low level software that interacts b/w a user and hardware components providing a interface as an abstraction.
- It is responsible for
  1.  Processor management
  2.  Memory management
  3.  I/O Device management
  4.  File management
  5.  Pheripherals
  6.  Network
  7.  Security
- An operating system is a main program on computer, that governs all other applications.

## Process management

1. Creation, Sheduling and termination of processes and deadlock.
2. A process is a instance of a program which is under execution.
3. OS must allocate resources, and protect other process form accessing other process.

## POSIX

- posix is **Portable Operating System Interface**
- It’s a family of standards specified by IEEE for maintaining **compatibility among operating systems**.
- POSIX was introduced so that programmers need not to write same softwore for different operaaring systems running on disfferent environment.
- POSIX defines its standards in terms of the C language.
- Therefore, programs are portable to other operating systems at the source code level.
- POSIX also added rules for writing programs
  1.  safety for the initialization of pointer types and concurrent executions.
  2.  enforces rules for memory synchronization, such as restricting memory modification when it’s already in use.
  3.  It also states security mechanisms for directory protection and file access.
- STDIN - 0
- STDOUT - 1
- STDERR - 2
