## POSIX

- posix is **Portable Operating System Interface**
- It’s a family of standards specified by IEEE for maintaining **compatibility among operating systems**.
- POSIX was introduced so that programmers need not to write same softwore for different operaaring systems running on disfferent environment.
- POSIX defines its standards in terms of the C language.
- Therefore, programs are portable to other operating systems at the source code level.
- POSIX also added rules for writing programs
  1.  safety for the initialization of pointer types and concurrent executions.
  2.  enforces rules for memory synchronization, such as restricting memory modification when it’s already in use.
  3.  It also states security mechanisms for directory protection and file access.
- STDIN - 0
- STDOUT - 1
- STDERR - 2
