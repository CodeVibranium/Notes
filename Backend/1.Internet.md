## Internet

- The internet is the world’s most popular computer network.
- It’s organized as a decentralized network of networks.

## Internet Address - IP address

## Data transmission - Protocol

- Therefore the message must be translated from alphabetic text into electronic signals, transmitted over the Internet, then translated back into alphabetic text
- The protocol stack used on the Internet is refered to as the **TCP/IP** protocol stack

## TCP protocol

1. Application protocols (Protocol specific to web, email, ftp etc..)
2. Transmission control protocol (directs packets to a specific apllication on a computer using a port number)
3. Internet protocol (directs packets to a specific computer using an IP address)\
4. Hardware layer (Converts binary packets to network signal and vice versa) (NIC, MODEM)

### Caveats

1. If the message to be sent is long, each stack layer that the message passes through may break the message up into smaller chunks of data. These chunks of data are known as packets. Each packet can store max data of **64 kilobytes**
2. In IP layer packets gets assigned to IP address.
3. Then these packets go through the ISP and The ISPs router examines the destination address in each packet and determines where to send it.
4. Eventually the packets reach destination computer and the packets start at the bottom of the destination computer's TCP/IP stack and work upwards.
5. When a packet arrives at a router, the router examines the IP address put there by the IP protocol layer on the originating computer.If the network containing the IP address is found, the packet is sent to that network. If the network containing the IP address is not found, then the router sends the packet on a default route, usually up the backbone hierarchy to the next router.

## DNS

1.  The DNS is a distributed database which keeps track of computer's names and their corresponding IP addresses on the Internet.
2.  If a DNS server does not contain the domain name requested by another computer, the DNS server re-directs the requesting computer to another DNS server.

## HTTP application layer protocol.

1. If the URL contains a domain name, the browser first connects to a domain name server and retrieves the corresponding IP address for the web server.
2. The web browser connects to the web server and sends an HTTP request (via the protocol stack) for the desired web page.
3. The web server receives the request and checks for the desired page. If the page exists, the web server sends it. If the server cannot find the requested page, it will send an HTTP 404 error message
4. The web browser receives the page back and the connection is **closed**.
5. The browser then parses through the page and looks for other page elements it needs to complete the web page. These usually include images, applets, etc.
6. **Important** For each element needed, the browser makes additional connections and HTTP requests to the server for each element.

## TCP

- When the TCP layer receives the application layer protocol data from above, it segments it into manageable 'chunks' and then adds a TCP header with specific TCP information to each 'chunk'. The information contained in the TCP header includes the port number of the application the data needs to be sent to.
- When the TCP layer receives a packet from the IP layer below it, the TCP layer strips the TCP header data from the packet, does some data reconstruction if necessary, and then sends the data to the correct application using the port number taken from the TCP header.
- TCP is a **connection-oriented**, reliable, byte stream service.
- Connection-oriented means that two applications using TCP must first establish a connection before exchanging data.
- **Important** TCP is reliable because for each packet received, an acknowledgement is sent to the sender to confirm the delivery.
- TCP also includes a checksum in it's header for error-checking the received data.
- There is no place for an IP address in the TCP header.This is because TCP doesn't know anything about IP addresses. **The task of getting data from computer to computer is the job of IP**s.
- TCP's job is to get application level data from application to application reliably.

## IP

- IP's job is too send and route packets to other computers.
- IP packets are independent entities and may arrive out of order or not at all.
- **Important** It is TCP's job to make sure packets arrive and are in the correct order.
- About the only thing IP has in common with TCP is the way it receives data and adds it's own IP header information to the TCP data.

## Port

- a port is a number between 1 and 65535 that differntiated services on the system
- ftp:21, http:80,ssh:22, smtp:25,https:443,mysql:3306,5432:psql,6667:irc

## Server

- A Computer that listens for incoming req.

## Clients

- Compiter that initiates a connecttion

## 3-Way handshake.

- TCP's three-way handshake has two important functions.
- It makes sure that both sides know that they are ready to transfer data and it also allows both sides to agree on the initial sequence numbers, which are sent and acknowledged (so there is no mistake about them) during the handshake.

- So, How does it work.
- A three way handshake is important because in a transmission connection protocol, packets which are sent are acknowledged to the sender upon recievd and it is responsibility of the sender to send packets again if the packets are not recieved.

- So to make sure these happen the client and sender must have an established connection, to establish a connection

1. Clients send a request with it sequence number and synchronization number (x).
   - Sequence number is important because it is for server to send acknowledegment to that request.
2. Upon getting the req, server parses the req and if the req is valid, server acknowledges the req and increments the sync value by 1 and sends ack value and a new sync value to the client.
3. When client recieves, it updates the recieved sync by 1.
4. When server recieves the updated value, it is confirmed that the connection is working and thus established.

- Because, now the connection is established, data can be transferred and recieved.

## DNS

- Domain Name System.
- Each device on the internet has an IP Address and **DNS** helps get IP address from the domain name
- A domain name is a human readable address for any web server available on the internet.
- _FUN-FACT_ No one owns the domain name, these domain name are just rented and become available to use again by someone else

### How DNS request work?

1. Request goes through browser, browser checks for the relevant domainName which will be stored in browser cache if the website visited recently, if not resolved,
2. DNS cache of the operating system might have it cached, these dns chache will be saved in hosts file in the machine, if not resolved,
3. Then request goes to **Recursive DNS servers** (RDS) (Normally your **ISP**) which has list of records which other users linked to this **ISP** might have visited, if not resolved,
4. These DNS request will go to **ROOT Dns Servers**. This server only **Top Level Domain** data, such relevant ip address for **TLD servers** suchas .com server ip, .gov.in server ip etc..
5. Then TLD server ip is returned back to **RDS**
6. Then **RDS**, forwards this request to **TLD server**, thus the ip is found and data request is resolved.

### DNS Records

1. A record -> Address record indicates IP address of the domain.
2. CNAME record -> Canonical record points a domain/sub-domain to another domain
3. MX record -> Mail exchanger , helps routes emails to relevant server. (priority queue)
4. TXT record -> Txt record
5. NS record -> Name server record Indicate authoritative servers

## OSI Model

- Open system interconnection model
- defines how data is transferred between devices
