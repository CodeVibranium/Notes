# Caching

- caching is the process of storing frequently accessed data in temporary files so that it can be accessed quickly.
- It improves website **performance** by **reducing the amount of time it takes to load web page and other resources**

## Type of caching.

1. Browser caching
   - it can store images, scripts, stylesheets and html files, mainly content which is **static** should be cached.
2. Server caching
   - can cache both static(html) and dynamic content (db Query)
3. CDN caching.
4. Database cache.
   - can store frequently accessed data in memory reducing the no disk read and writes.
   - should be carefully managed to avois using too much memory.
5. Application caching (API)
   - a.k.a broswer caching or client side caching.
   - stores web resources such as html, css and js and images on client side.
   - which improves faster access and performance/
   - when user visists a website for the first time it caches the website reouces so that it can retrieved for the next time quicker.
   - done using `Application Caching API`.
   - It is different from `HTTP caching` because
   - HTTP caching stores resources in the browser's cache based on the **HTTP headers sent by the server**, application caching stores resources based on a **manifest file created by the web developer**.
6. API Cache.
   - `apicache` npm package.
   - `node-cache` npm package.
   - `redis-cache` npm package.
   - `memory-cache`
   - `cache-manager`
7. Full page caching

# Headers

- Some import headers that will make a difference

1. `Cache-Control` header
2. `Expires`
3. `ETag`
4. `Last-Modified`
5. `if-none-match`
6. `if-modifed-since`
