- focussing on
- NGINX is a reverse proxy server at core.

## NGINX as a reverse propxy

- Apache
- faster static resouce
- higher concurrency
- `nginx.conf`
- nginx interprets each incoming request as URI locations where as apcahe interprets each req as file system location.

## FIND NGINX conf file

- nginx -t
- which nginx
