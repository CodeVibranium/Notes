## Lexical scope

- It means that the scope of variable is determined by the physical location of it in the code.
- In JavaScript, each function when invoked creates a new scope, and each function has access to variables in its own scope, any outer (parent) scopes, and the global scope.
- Nested functions can access variables in outer scopes, but the reverse isn't true. This allows us to create private variables that can only be accessed by specific functions, providing a form of encapsulation.
