# this

- `this` refers to the object that is currently owning the execution of code
- it determines the scope of the function and meths
- The value of `this` is evaluated during the run-time, depending on the context.
- **VERY IMP** this is not determined by how a function is defined, but by how it's called. ex(refer to code 1)
  1. when a call function as a property `this` refers to calling object
  2. when u call funtion is global scope `this` refers to global
  3. when u call the same function in conetxt of another function then `this` would refer to that functions `this` not the global`this`

## this in a method

- A method is a property of an object.
- the value of `this` inside a method refers to **calling object**

## **Arrow function have no `this`**

- if we try to access this in a arrow function it will access this of its nearest to it

## TRICKY (PITFALL)

- When a function is called as a method (i.e., object.method()), JavaScript automatically sets this inside the function to refer to the object. That's just how method calls work in JavaScript.
- A decalred function has its own `this`, but just because it is declared inside an object which technically makes it a method(), JS set the `this` of this function as `this` of the object

## CODE 1

```js
var myObject = {
  property: "I belong to myObject",
  myMethod: function () {
    console.log(this.property);
    setTimeout(
      function () {
        console.log(this.property);
      }.bind(this),
      1000
    );
  },
};

myObject.myMethod();

("use strict");
function outer() {
  return () => console.log(this);
}
outer()(); // logs: undefined
```

- here myMethod is called as a method that why `this` mentioned inside the function refers to the myObject
- but `this` in `setTimeout` is not called immediately so it will run after the execution of this code so then this anonmyous function is runnign in context of `GLOABL`scope so `this` refer to `GLOBAL` here.

## CALL, APPLY & BIND

1. CALL(): it takes `this` as its first argument and applies it to function and the rest of the arguments indiviually
2. APPLY(): it takes `this` as its first argument and applies it to function and the rest of the arguments in an array
3. BIND(): it takes `this` as its first argument and **returns a function** with `this` applied and the rest of the arguments indiviually

## What will be the this if iffe?

- that depends onwhere the code is executed but genreally it would gloabl this

## this in event Listener

- in an event listener function `this` refers to the **element that recieved the event** not the context where the event was handled
