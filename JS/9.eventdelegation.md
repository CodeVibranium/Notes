# Event Delegation

- Target is thing upon whch we clicked.
- Events work in this in this way.
  1. Capture phase:When an event is fired, it first travels from the Window object down to the actual target element.
  2. Target phase: This is the phase where the event has reached the target element (the element that the event is directly fired on).
  3. Bubbling Phase: After reaching the target, the event then starts to travel back up the DOM tree from the target element to the Window object. This process is known as event bubbling.
