# Hoisting

- In simple words hoisitng in js is a concept where the functions and variable decalrations are moved to the top of the scope during compliation anad a default value is set to `undefined` .
- `let a` is decalrations
- `let a =5` is both declaration and initialization.

## Function hoisting

- Function declarations are hoisted in their entirety, meaning the function name and the function body are hoisted ( all the logic part too)

## Why is HOISTING DONE?

- To understand this we must first understand compliation behaviour of JS.
- JS does this thwo pass compliation process
- During the first pass, JS engine reads through entire code and sets up all the variable and function declaration sin ,emenru which effectively hositis them to the top of scope.
- During the second pass, JS engines exceutes it line by line

## JS Pre processing phase

1. Preprocessing Phase (Compilation-like):
   - hoists function ad variable declartions to the top of the scope.
   - This phase doesn't execute the logic of the code, it simply prepares the scope for the execution phase.
2. Execution Phase (Interpretation-like):
   - During this phase, the JavaScript engine runs through the code again, executing each line in order
3. The preprocessing phase allows **JavaScript engines to better manage memory allocation** and **speeds up identifier resolution by knowing where all the variables and functions are in advance.**
