# COPY

1. **Shallow copy**: In a shallow copy, a new object is created and the values of the original object are copied into the new object. However, if the original object has references to other objects (like arrays or objects), only the references are copied, not the actual referenced objects. This means changes to the referenced objects within the copied object will affect the original object and vice versa. In JavaScript, you can create a shallow copy using methods like Object.assign() or the spread operator ({...obj}).

2. **Deep copy**: In a deep copy, a new object is created and the values of the original object are copied into the new object. But, importantly, all referenced objects are also copied, not just the references. This means changes to the referenced objects within the copied object will not affect the original object, and vice versa.
