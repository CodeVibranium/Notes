# Autoboxing

- To understand autoboxing we first need to need to get a glance about JS primitive data types
- Primitive type is a type of data type that is not an object and has no properties and methods attached to it.
- These data types are
  1. string
  2. number
  3. booleabn
  4. undefined
  5. bigint
  6. null
  7. symbol
  8. and the most distinguishable part about these data type is that THESE values are **immutable**, which means unless once reassigned these values never change for ex:
     1. by calling `toUpperCase()` the original value doesnt change
     2. but by calling `.push` `pull` original value is **changed**
- but if you see string has methods attched to it like `toString()`, `toUpperCase()` and properties such as `length`, then doesnt this violate the above statment
- Yes, it does but JS is clever
- JS convert primitves types to objects to provide a more flexible and powerful API to developers.
- **This feature is often referred to as "autoboxing".**

## But why does JS does **AUTO BOXING**

- The main purpose of autoboxing is to allow you to use methods and properties associated with wrapper objects (like String, Number, and Boolean) directly on primitive values.
- This happens "behind the scenes" and is abstracted away from the developer, so it feels as if primitives have methods and properties.
- JavaScript does this because, while primitives are efficient and simple, they're also limited. Objects, on the other hand, are more complex and versatile - they can have properties and methods. Autoboxing allows developers to get the best of both worlds: the efficiency of primitives and the versatility of objects.
