# Promise

- A Promise in JavaScript is an `object` representing a value which may not be available yet, but will be resolved at some point in the future or rejected. This allows asynchronous operations to be handled with the same sort of good/bad pathway (fulfillment or rejection) logic that synchronous operations have.
- **Promise.all(iterable)**: The Promise.all(iterable) method returns a single Promise that fulfills when all of the promises passed as an iterable (for example, an array) have been fulfilled, or when the iterable contains no promises. If any of the passed **promises rejects**, the returned promise from Promise.all **immediately rejects with that reason,** **not waiting for the rest of the promises to complete.**
- **Promise.race(iterable):** This method returns a promise that **fulfills or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the iterable resolves or rejects**, with the value or reason from that promise.
- **Promise.allSettled(iterable)**: This method returns a promise that resolves after all of the given promises have either fulfilled or rejected, with an array of objects that each describes the outcome of each promise
