# Generators

## Purpose

> The purpose of a generator function is to run some code an return some value and run some more code and return some value and so on...
> Simply code pauses after every yield.next()

## Syntax

> To declare a generator function you need to add \* symbol after the keyword symbol
> `function *`
> A generator function can have yield
> A Yeild is a special type of return keyword

> **_Important_** When you call a generator, it just sets up the generator object, essentially create a object which has next property.

## Return

> Return of a generator function is generator object

> each return has 3 next(), return() and throw()

> each generator return will have `{value:x, done:bool}`

> **_IMPORTANT_** Done false means there is still more code to run, true means there is no moree code to run.
> use .return() method exit out of generator immediately
