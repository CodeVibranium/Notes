# Closure

- A closure is function that has access to own scope, outer scope and gloabl scope as well as function parameters and variables even after its execution

## How it works?

- When a function is invoked, a new execution context is created and added to the execution stack.
- When the function finishes executing, its execution context is removed from the stack.
- However, if a nested function maintains a reference to its parent's variable environment, that environment is not garbage collected (**BUT WHY**)
- This is because, when the outer function has executed it has returned an inner function and this data cannot be garabage collected because there is still a reference of the inner function in the program because of this sole reason the closure is maintained.
- And at any moment relase the memomry of this variable, JS grabage coolects this colusre and its data.
